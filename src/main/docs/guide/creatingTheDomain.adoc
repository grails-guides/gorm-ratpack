Create two domain objects.

 - `Manufacturer.groovy`
 - `Vehicle.groovy`

Feel free to use your favorite IDE to create these or execute the following

[source,bash]
----
$ cd complete/src/main/groovy/demo
$ touch Manufacturer.groovy
$ touch Vehicle.groovy
----

Now that all our class stubs are in place lets go ahead and edit them.

[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/Manufacturer.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/demo/Manufacturer.groovy[]
----

[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/domain/Vehicle.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/demo/Vehicle.groovy[]
----

`Manufacturer` and `Vehicle` have a one-to-many relationship. 

We are using GORM outside of Grails. Because of that, we need to annotate our domain classes with the `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity`. Additionally we implement the `GormEntity` trait. It is merely to aid IDE support of GORM outside of Grails.
