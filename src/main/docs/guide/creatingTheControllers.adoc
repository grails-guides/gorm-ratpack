The previous code registers the `Module` which configures GORM, the `Service` which populates the database on start-up and the `Handler which handles the app.

Run the app: 

`./gradlew run`


You should be able to call the endpoints: 

`curl "http://localhost:5050"`

and get the response: 

`["audi","ford"]`

Or retrieve the vehicles of a manufacturer:

`curl "http://localhost:5050/audi/vehicles"`

and get the response: 

`["A3","A4"]`
